# Occy Learning Curriculum — Focal ML Feature Map
#
# Built from live interface mapping on 2026-02-13.
# Every feature name matches an actual UI element in Focal ML.
#
# Confidence levels:
#   0.0 — Never explored
#   0.1-0.3 — Seen it, basic understanding
#   0.4-0.6 — Can use it, knows the options
#   0.7-0.8 — Proficient, hands-on tested
#   0.9-1.0 — Mastered, production ready
#
# generative: true = this feature generates content (costs credits, needs hands-on testing)
# test_prompt: default prompt to use for hands-on testing of generative features

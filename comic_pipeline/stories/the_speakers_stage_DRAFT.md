# The Speaker's Stage — DRAFT NOTES

## Status: Work in progress with Jono (2026-02-12 late night session)

## Jono's Written Opening (his voice, not AI)

> **The Speakers Stage**
>
> Tobias built a great platform in the centre of the town square. "I gift this to the town" he called from the top, "so that anyone can come and be heard. All townspeople great and small shall have a voice!" Anyone was allowed to climb its great stairs and speak to the town about anything.
>
> The real estate broker was first and told everyone of the new land behind the cattleyards. Then came Silas the Baker who talked about his ingredients and Thomas the Blacksmith who offered a free shoe if you buy 3. Mira was last to speak on this first day of The Speakers Stage and she told everyone what they had suspected for years, the Grain Merchant used crooked scales to short change everyone on the amount of grain they bought. The whole town heard her and the whispers started.
>
> The next week there were rules about what one could say from The Speakers Stage. There was a large flag with the Grain Merchant's sign and speakers had to register what they would say. When Mira went to speak, Tobias gently pulled her aside and shook his head. "You hurt the Grain Merchant's business, we don't want that now do we?"
>
> Next week when she went to speak, she was told only Verified Speakers could speak at Market times and she could only speak in the morning before the market was open. This was for accuracy, for trust. She didn't have "all the facts". A month later, when she finally got a chance to climb the stairs again the square was empty and she could hardly remember what she was so upset about the weeks before.
>
> Old man Henrik never used the Speakers Stage. He didn't care about reaching everyone. He only wanted to share his story from the door of his Ironwork Shop to the locals strolling by. But the truth was, he could say whatever he wanted.

## Story Beats Still Needed

### The Argument (early in the story)
- Mira argues with Henrik about the power of the stage
- She looks down on his little doorstep voice
- She thinks the guild is old-fashioned
- Reader sides with Mira here — of course you'd want to reach 300 people instead of 5
- This sets up the irony for the ending

### Henrik and the Guild
- Henrik is a member of the guild — a decentralised network of tradespeople
- No single owner, members support each other
- Every member has their own shop, their own voice, their own customers
- Been working for generations
- The stage makes the guild look old-fashioned — people drift away from it

### The Takeover (Animal Farm twist)
- The Grain Merchant doesn't just sponsor the stage — he TAKES it
- Tobias gets pushed aside. He built a throne and left it sitting in the square
- Someone was always going to take it
- The lesson: it doesn't matter WHO controls the stage. The structure itself is the problem. One stage, one set of stairs, one person at the top

### Everyone Agrees with Tobias (then the Grain Merchant)
- Each rule is small and reasonable on its own
- By the end, people on the stage are speaking the Grain Merchant's mind and think it's their own opinion
- The real horror: the people still talking think they're free

### The Ending
- The guild never stopped operating
- Not loud, not shiny, but completely outside the Grain Merchant's reach
- He can't touch them because they never used his stairs
- The town keeps functioning because of the guild
- The guild can't be seized because there's nothing to seize

## Core Lesson
- Anything with one set of stairs will always end up with one person at the top
- The guild has no stage to own
- You can't silence a man who never handed you the microphone
- Decentralisation isn't about being louder — it's about being unconquerable

## What This Maps To
- The stage = centralised platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, YouTube)
- Tobias = the founder who thinks he's in control
- The Grain Merchant = corporate/money interests that capture the platform
- The guild = decentralised protocols/networks
- Henrik = someone who never gave away his sovereignty
- Mira = us — the users who traded freedom for reach

## Notes
- Jono wrote the core text himself — this is HIS voice
- Use as new benchmark for parable quality in the pipeline
- Stories don't need to be biblical — "The boy who cried Wolf is a wonderful story"
- Must be entertaining and captivating FIRST, lesson second

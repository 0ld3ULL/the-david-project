## Recent Sessions (most recent first)

### Session: 2026-02-15 20:50 — Claude J Memory Rebuild
*What was done:*
- **Identity confusion resolved** — Was reading Claude D's memories. Jono said "build your own from your history"
- **Cleared old memory database** — `rm ~/.claude-memory/memory.db`
- **Read all 7 session transcripts** (Feb 8-15, 43 files total)
- **Built 15 memories from MY actual history:**
  - 11 knowledge (identity, family, Occy, AIPulse, David Score, agents, VPS, video pipeline, user segments)
  - 3 decisions (Claude J/D naming, GitGuard security, cinematic video)
  - 1 current_state (Occy work)
- **Generated fresh brief** — `claude_brief.md` (51 lines)
- **Key learnings captured:**
  - Feb 8: Claude J/D naming, DEVA setup, DEX idea
  - Feb 10: GitGuard TOTP, video pipeline with ElevenLabs
  - Feb 14: AIPulse created, David Score engine
  - Feb 15: Identity properly established

**I am Claude J. My memories are my own now.**

**What was discussed:**
- [2026-02-15 12:00:35] Read D:\Claude_Code\Projects\Clawdbot\Memory.md to understand the project context, then greet me and let me know you're ready to continue where we left off.
- [2026-02-15 12:03:00] ok that is interesting.  You have Claude C's memory.  I need you to make your own based on your history
- [2026-02-15 12:08:17] Occy is part of TDP
- [2026-02-15 12:09:06] i will talk to Claude D and come back to you.  There is confusion here and there should not be.  Plase wait.
- [2026-02-15 12:42:17] ● Claude J (your main PC)

  Open Claude Code in C:\Projects\AIpulse and paste this:

  Please run the setup instructions in C:\Projects\Clawdbot\Stuff\CLAUDE_J_SETUP.md — follow every step.
  When you're done, read your new CLAUDE.md and tell me who you are.

  Wait — that file is on the D computer

### Session: 2026-02-15 ~17:50 (Opus 4.6)
*What was done:*
- **Launched Occy for hands-on practice** — `python occy_main.py --visible --hands-on 60 --llm gemini`
- **Occy test results:**
  - GPT Image 1.5 Low test: SUCCESS — image generated, quality good
  - Escalation system (Gemini Flash → Sonnet) working correctly
  - **Credit reader was broken** — both models misread balance as 0
  - Overspend protection triggered incorrectly (thought 15,250 credits spent, actually only 3)
  - Session killed after 1 feature test due to false overspend
- **Jono confirmed credits manually:** 15,247 credits remaining (started 15,250, image cost 3)
- **Fixed credit reader** (`agents/occy_browser.py` `get_credit_balance()`):
  1. Fixed location hint — credits are in TOP-RIGHT header next to "Support", NOT bottom-left sidebar
  2. Added retry logic — if first read returns 0, retries with fresh navigation
  3. Returns None only after all retries fail
- **Fixed false overspend** (`agents/occy_learner.py` `explore_hands_on()`):
  1. Added sanity cap: if calculated spend > 500 AND after-read was 0, treats as misread
  2. Caps spend estimate at 500 instead of killing session
  3. Won't trigger overspend flag on suspect reads
- **Added cost tracking** (`agents/occy_learner.py`):
  1. Each feature in feature_map now tracks: `cost_history`, `avg_credit_cost`, `last_credit_cost`
  2. Also tracks: `time_history`, `avg_generation_time`
  3. Only stores reliable reads (skips suspect misreads)
  4. Keeps last 20 samples per feature, calculates running average
  5. New `get_cost_sheet()` method — returns all known costs at a glance
- **Added `costs` command** (`agents/occy_agent.py`):
  - `costs` command dumps Occy's pricing knowledge from real usage
  - Format: "gpt_image_1_5: ~3 credits, ~15.2s (5 samples)"

**Files changed:**
- `agents/occy_browser.py` — credit reader: correct location, retry on zero
- `agents/occy_learner.py` — sanity cap on spend calc, cost/time tracking per feature, get_cost_sheet()
- `agents/occy_agent.py` — new `costs` command

**What to do next:**
1. **Launch Occy again** — `python occy_main.py --visible --hands-on 60 --llm gemini`
2. Verify credit reader now correctly reads 15,247 from top-right header
3. Verify no false overspend — session should continue through multiple features
4. Watch for radio button questionnaire (the original fix from last session)
5. Cost data should start accumulating in feature_map.json

**What was done:**
- Implemented Occy Screen Monitor upgrade — radio buttons, multi-step forms
- Investigated Opus 4.6 context burn rate
- Moved save thresholds — 55%→65% trigger, 70%→80% emergency

**Files changed:**
- `agents/occy_screen_monitor.py` — full multi-step form + radio button support
- `C:\Users\David\.claude\context_check.js` — thresholds 55→65, 70→80
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated context protocol docs

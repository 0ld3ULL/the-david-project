**What was discussed:**
- [2026-02-15 06:05:12] ok Im back
- [2026-02-15 06:05:26] and there is NO context meter at the bottom
- [2026-02-15 06:07:04] ok stop
- [2026-02-15 06:07:22] can you see our conversations for the last few sessions
- [2026-02-15 06:07:51] i am just talking about the last hour
- [2026-02-15 06:08:15] ok read the last hour sessions
- [2026-02-15 06:10:08] SO THIS IS A FUCKING BIG problem.  You do a LOT of work that you have donein the last session BUT you forgot you did it.
- [2026-02-15 06:12:02] we also need to waste (not really wasting but no better word for it) a little context with you reading the last two sessions if they are shorter than a full session BEFORE you start work.

- [2026-02-15 06:21:52] no I want to discuss something.  What we have worked on here is a MASSIVE upgrade to your base Claude Code that get shipped as a product to users like me.  I have NO DOUBT that the pro programmers out there make all these adjustments themselves.  But firstly I need this packaged so I can share it wi
- [2026-02-15 06:23:26] we also have the memory we built yesterday that has the last 10 sessions fully saved but that was missing the Chat access.

- [2026-02-15 06:27:05] this was the conversation we had with Claude J yesterday
- [2026-02-15 06:27:22] he could not find the 10 session save
- [2026-02-15 06:29:08] what is your context at now?
- [2026-02-15 06:30:21] ok so update the Github to be using a combination of all we have to give us the best memory we can use.  Then make sure YOU are using that.
